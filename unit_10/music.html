		<p id="musicp">On Friday, I was so tired after work that I basically crashed.  I really wanted to be a trooper and leave my apartment and walk one block, but it wasn't happening.  Besides, I had a pretty packed weekend ahead and that made me feel less guilty about not sitting at a bar by myself staring at all the really good looking people.<br>

		<br>On Saturday, I cleaned up my apartment a bit because I kind of have to clean on a weekly basis.  It's what I do.  Ask my friend Michael.  Then I went to the water as per usual and chilled with a book and a coffee.  People were sunbathing and actually swimming in the water.   I, on the other hand, wore a very loose fitting dress AKA the opposite of wearing a bathing suit.  I'm not there yet.<br>

		<br>I went to Rebecka's house for dinner and to meet her children, Iris and Otto.   They do not speak English but they made a lot of faces at me and giggled.  Iris seemed like she spoke her mind and Otto seemed like he liked being silly.  My interpretation as they kept saying Swedish things to me.   Robert and Rebecka made a Mexican themed dinner which was really good.  After all, I do love Mexican food.  After dinner, Rebecka and I headed out to the ABBA museum.<br>  

		<br>The ABBA museum is the greatest museum ever.  Sure people like the Guggenheim or the Louvre, but nothing can top the fun I had here.  Well at least not yet.  This weekend is the Eurovision Song Contest, so they were having a party there at the museum.  Shockingly, we weren't invited, but that is ok. The museum was fairly empty for our arrival, so we got to do everything possible.  You can sing, dance, be a 5th ABBA member on stage, perform in your own music video, and play with instruments.  It's like everything I like doing in one museum.<br>

		<br>After the museum, we went to Erik's Gondolen for a drink.  It's a bar/restaurant that is high above the city with great views.  You can also walk outside and take pictures.  It got pretty cold, so we didn't do that, but we did enjoy our drinks. All in all, a perfect evening (up until I got home and fell on the lobby concrete floor (NBD)).<br>
