		<p id="travelp">Walked around Sodermalm today.  Nothing particular happened.  It was freezing because it snowed this morning but it was my first official day in Stockholm so I wasn't going to sit home.   I took about a 2 hour walk around town and did more food shopping.<br> 

		<br>I found out that there is only one chain that you can buy alcohol and it's owned by the government.  I just reminded myself that I have yet to buy any wine for the apartment I am staying at.   I will fix that tomorrow.<br>

		<br>The first night I went to eat and did some bar hopping with my friend Jakob.  By 9pm he could see that my eyes were slowly starting to close at a more rapid rate, so I went home.<br>

		<br>I accomplished my first terrifying leap into sleeping in a loft bed.  I didn't die yet. But it was only one night.  I'm really unclear how this thing is being held together, but I assume they know what they are doing.  I'm basically living in an Ikea ad.<br>

		<br>I cooked all of my meals today since it was pretty nasty out and since it is pretty expensive.  It took only 	10 minutes to figure out that I needed a lighter to get the stove working.  Better late than never.<br>

		<br>I'm learning Swedish words pretty fast due to the fact that all the food I'm buying is written in Swedish.  I made this a priority after buying club soda and not water by accident.  Live and learn.<br>

		<br>The rest of the week looks lovely, so hopefully I can take a picture that's not dark and gloomy.<br>
